An impactful machine learning project developed during my internship as a **Data Analysis Intern** at **Dreamline AI**. This model classifies users based on their eligibility for regional incentive programsâ€”empowering smarter, data-driven decisions in targeted outreach.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Highlights

âœ… Developed a full pipeline from raw user data to actionable predictions
âœ… Worked with **real-world multi-region data** (demographics, transactions, behavior)
âœ… Achieved **100% accuracy** with a well-tuned Random Forest model
âœ… Engineered and validated a model that streamlines incentive distribution

---

## ðŸ”§ Machine Learning Workflow

**1. Data Handling**
â†’ Leveraged **Pandas** and **NumPy** to clean and process regional user datasets

**2. Feature Engineering**
â†’ Encoded categorical features using **LabelEncoder** and **OneHotEncoder** within a **ColumnTransformer**

**3. Model Training**
â†’ Built a robust classification pipeline using **RandomForestClassifier** wrapped in a **Scikit-learn Pipeline**

**4. Evaluation**
â†’ Evaluated model performance using **classification\_report** and **accuracy\_score**:

### âœ… Final Output:

```
Model Accuracy: 1.0
